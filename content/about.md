Do you ever feel alone and isolated in your cubicle; fighting the Cyberwar unnoticed and underappreciated?

Do you ever long for a companion to trade stories with who understands what it's like in the "trenches" of the Enterprise Information Security Landscape?

Don't despair, for you are not alone! Come join your fellow Cybersecurity professionals from Atlanta and the surrounding areas for a cold beer, a few war stories, and a wholesome helping of camraderie!
